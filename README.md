# Hackathon-25
Objective of RE-DACT
- Purpose: Develop a secure redaction/anonymization tool that enables users to redact, mask, or generate synthetic data with a customizable redaction scale.
- The tool enables secure, customizable, and scalable data redaction with AI-driven anonymization.
- RE-DACT enables secure, AI-driven data redaction and anonymization with customizable privacy levels.
  # Main Goals of RE-DACT
- Develop an AI-powered redaction tool for secure data anonymization.
- Enable gradational redaction, allowing users to control the level of data masking.
- Support multiple input formats (text, images, PDFs, videos) and structured output.
- Ensure data privacy by preventing third-party storage or retrieval.
- Build an intuitive web-based and offline GUI for easy accessibility.
- Implement machine learning to improve redaction accuracy over time.
 # Expected Outcomes
- A functional PoC demonstrating real-time redaction capabilities.
- Improved precision, recall, and F1-score in redaction tasks.
- A scalable system with minimal API dependency and optimized computing.
# Challenges
- Manual Redaction: Most redaction and anonymization processes are time-consuming and require custom scripts or manual effort.
- Lack of Flexibility: Existing tools don't offer customizable redaction levels based on user needs.
- Data Privacy Concerns: Some tools store or process data externally, risking exposure of sensitive information.
- Offline Availability: Many solutions rely on internet access, lacking offline functionality for secure environments.
# Conclusion & Unique Solutions
- AI-Driven Smart Redaction – Use NLP and ML models to automatically detect and redact sensitive data with contextual understanding.
- Multi-Format Support – Enable redaction across diverse formats like text, PDFs, images, and videos.
- Secure Synthetic Data Generation – Create realistic anonymized datasets for research, testing, and sharing without revealing original data.
- Offline & Web-Based Access – Provide both online and offline usability for secure environments.
